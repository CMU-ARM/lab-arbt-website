  <p align="left"> This research is part of a <a href="http://www.cmu.edu" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a> project, in support of a larger effort, partly in collaboration with the <a href="http://pitt.edu" target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh</a>, on robots and computing technology that can help travelers with disabilities in urban travel settings. Ideal candidates for this study are visually impaired, deafblind, mobility constrained, and/or experts on the topic of navigation for travelers with visual or mobility challenges. To ensure that the outcomes of this work are relevant to people with disabilities, we request your participation in completing surveys.</p>
  <p align="left">The purpose of the surveys is to better understand the specific needs and preferences of people with disabilities for wayfinding and navigation in outdoor and indoor environments. The data will be used to identify the challenges in wayfinding and navigation faced by different groups and individuals and to design new tools that can provide suitable routes and assist in navigating through accessible elements of the outdoor and indoor environments.</p>
  <p align="left">Please complete the  two online surveys. 
    Each survey should take approximately one hour to complete (approximately two hours for both surveys). 
    You do not have to complete both surveys in one sitting and in chronological order. You may also save your responses and complete the survey over a period of time (upon first save you will be prompted to create a username and password). <strong>Should you wish to participate, the deadline to complete and submit the surveys is 
      Monday, July 21 at 5:00pm EST</strong>.</p>
  <p align="left">When you click on the survey link, the survey will open in a new window or tab. 
    Once you have completed the survey, simply exit the window or tab. <strong>Please note that if a survey is left idle for more than 10 minutes (e.g. you do not select an answer, type an answer, move on to the next question, save your answers, submit your answers, etc.), the session will expire. You will need to refresh the survey link, click on the &quot;Load unfinished survey&quot; button and follow the instructions. Your last saved survey session will be loaded. We recommend saving your responses often.</strong></p>
  <p align="left">Your participation is completely voluntary and you may choose to stop at any time. There is no cost to participate in this study and you will not receive compensation for your participation. Survey data will be anonymous, however we provide an <strong>OPTIONAL</strong> opportunity to provide your contact information if you wish to be contacted in the future about testing opportunities or other activities related to this research.</p>
